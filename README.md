Simple Git (Github) CLI made in Node.js

## Quickstart

The CLI is self-documented, just follow the steps to perform a commit.

## Requirements

- The repository should be in Github and the URL should appear in the `package.json`.
- For releases you should install GH Cli and configure it.
- Issue selector doesn't work for private repos (WIP).
